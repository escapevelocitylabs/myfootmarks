# Research Arts

Run live web research on arts venues at the active trip's destination — galleries, art museums, performing-arts venues (theater, dance, opera), and arts districts. Write findings to `research/arts.md`.

## Inputs

**Required:** `Trips/<slug>/trip.yaml`

**Optional:** none

## Output

`.myfootmarks/trips/<slug>/research/arts.md` — markdown document with YAML frontmatter carrying a structured `places:` array plus the human-readable body.

## Steps

### Step 1: Resolve the active trip

(Read `.myfootmarks/current-trip` → slug → `Trips/<slug>/trip.yaml`. Extract `destination`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `regions`, `travelers`, `budget_tier`. Bail to `/myfootmarks:intake` if missing.)

### Step 2: Gather enrichment context

This skill has no optional inputs. Proceed.

### Step 3: Dispatch the research subagent

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Prompt:

```
You are researching arts venues and events for a trip.

USE WEBSEARCH AND WEBFETCH FOR LIVE DATA. Exhibitions, season programming, and gallery hours change — verify with current sources.

Trip:
- Destination: <destination>
- Dates: <start_date> to <end_date>
- Regions of focus: <regions or "destination-wide">
- Travelers: <names with ages>
- Budget tier: <budget_tier>

Research the arts scene. Cover:
- Art museums (institutional / public collections)
- Commercial galleries (smaller, rotating exhibitions)
- Performing arts venues (theater, dance, opera, symphony)
- Arts districts or gallery walks
- Current exhibitions or performances during the trip window

Return your findings as TWO blocks: a structured `places:` YAML array AND a human-readable Markdown body.

## Shared schema: `places:` frontmatter

In addition to the existing markdown body, the subagent MUST emit a structured `places:` YAML array at the top of the output file alongside the existing `topic`, `generated_at`, `consumed_inputs` fields.

Schema per entry:

```yaml
places:
  - id: <slug>                      # stable slug: name lowercased, punctuation stripped, spaces hyphenated
    name: <string>
    wikidata_id: <Qnnnnn | null>    # Wikidata entity id; populated by find-place-image when source ∈ {wikidata-verified, rest-summary, wikivoyage-banner}
    commons_filename: <string | null>   # Commons filename when source is Wikimedia-backed
    image_url: <string | null>          # absolute thumbnail/image URL — populated for every source
    source: <string | null>             # rest-summary | wikidata-verified | wikivoyage-banner | openverse | commons-file-search | commons-category | subpage-og-image | homepage-og-image | null
    archetype: <string | null>          # destination | landmark | restaurant | event | dish | seasonal | neighborhood
    match_confidence: high | medium | low | null
    match_reason: <string | null>       # see find-place-image SKILL.md "Output" envelope
    lat: <float | null>             # decimal degrees
    lon: <float | null>
    category: <string>              # free-form; e.g. "museum-castle", "viewpoint", "pastelaria"
    lens: [<this-skill-lens>]       # single-entry array identifying THIS skill (see below)
    neighborhood: <string | null>   # free-form neighborhood label; aim for consistency with trip.yaml.regions
    address_street: <string | null>
    phone: <string | null>
    hours_structured:               # day-keyed open/close or null for closed/unknown
      mon: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
      tue: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
      wed: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
      thu: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
      fri: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
      sat: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
      sun: "HH:MM-HH:MM" | null
    reservation_url: <string | null>
    reservation_required: <bool>
    lead_time_days: <int | null>    # 0 = walk-up; null = no reservation expected
    signature: <string | null>      # one-line distinguishing note
    source_url: <string | null>
    stroller: <bool>                # age-fit triad
    with_kids: <bool>
    kid_first: <bool>
```

### `lens` values per skill (single-entry arrays)
- `research-attractions` → `[attraction]`
- `research-outdoor` → `[outdoor]`
- `research-scenic` → `[scenic]`
- `research-daytrips` → `[daytrip]`
- `research-shopping` → `[shopping]`
- `research-nightlife` → `[nightlife]`
- `research-music` → `[music]`
- `research-arts` → `[arts]`
- `research-restaurants` + `research-restaurants-kid-friendly` + `research-restaurants-local-cuisine` → `[food]`
- `research-events` → `[event]`
- `research-weather` → `[weather]` (one synthetic entry per trip; see Task A.7)
- `research-local-foods` → emits a `dishes:` array, NOT `places:` (see Task A.6)

### De-dup contract
`build-trip-book` Stage 1 merges per-place `lens` across all surfacing files (union). Downstream files do NOT need to know about cross-file aggregation — each file emits only its own lens.

### Missing data
Missing `wikidata_id`, `commons_filename`, `image_url`, `source`, `archetype`, `match_confidence`, `match_reason`, `hours_structured` entries, `phone`, `reservation_url`, etc. are ALL valid. The render handles absence as a first-class state. Emit `null` rather than omitting keys. When `find-place-image` returns `status: "no-image"`, set `wikidata_id` / `commons_filename` / `image_url` / `source` to `null`, but DO populate `archetype`, `match_confidence` (typically `null`), and `match_reason` so the audit table can reflect what was tried.

## Image resolution: delegate to `find-place-image`

For each entry in your `places:` array (or `dishes:` array, for `research-local-foods`), populate the image-resolution fields by invoking the `find-place-image` skill. **Do NOT** perform unverified `wbsearchentities` lookups inline — that path produced systemic misresolutions (Butchart Gardens → German Christmas store; BC Parliament → Bow Wow Wow band).

For each entity:

1. After resolving `name`, `category`, and (if available) `region` from `trip.yaml.destination`, invoke `find-place-image` with that triple. If you also have a confident `wikidata_id` from another source (e.g., a Wikipedia article that links to a Wikidata entity), pass it as well — `find-place-image` will run validate-mode and either confirm or reject it.

2. Take the resolver's JSON envelope and copy these fields directly into the corresponding `places:` (or `dishes:`) entry:
   - `wikidata_id` (may be null)
   - `commons_filename` (may be null)
   - `image_url` (may be null when status is `no-image`)
   - `source` (may be null when status is `no-image`)
   - `archetype` (always populated)
   - `match_confidence` → write to the entry's `match_confidence` field
   - `match_reason` → write to the entry's `match_reason` field

3. If the resolver returns `status: "no-image"`, that's a valid state — emit the entry with `wikidata_id: null`, `commons_filename: null`, `image_url: null`, `source: null`, but DO populate `archetype` and `match_reason`. The render handles `no-image` entries with a typography-only card (`data-variant="no-image"`).

4. **Do not retry or attempt manual lookups** when the resolver returns `no-image`. The trip planner can correct any single resolution after the first build via `trip.yaml.image_overrides`.

## Why this delegation matters

`find-place-image` is the one place where image-resolution logic lives. Improvements to it (e.g., better archetype heuristics, an additional source in a stack, a tightened P31 verifier) compound across every research skill automatically. The legacy per-skill inline Wikidata code is **deleted** during this migration; do not leave it commented out.

## Markdown body

Render the same venues/exhibitions as Markdown with one H3 per recommendation:

### <Venue / Exhibition / Performance name>

- **Location:** <neighborhood> — <address if known>
- **Type:** <art museum, gallery, theater, opera house, dance studio, arts district>
- **Hours:** <typical hours; flag closed days and evening extensions>
- **Current / coming-during-trip:** <if there's a specific exhibition or performance during the trip window, highlight it with dates>
- **Age fit:** <some art spaces are quiet-kid OK, some are very much not — be honest about this>
- **Cost:** <admission price or "free"; note free days where applicable>
- **Why it matters:** <one to two sentences>
- **Source:** <markdown link>

Order by your recommendation priority. Prioritize:
1. Specific exhibitions or performances dated within the trip window (highest value)
2. Institutions with permanent collections of unique regional or international significance
3. Arts districts where multiple galleries cluster (efficient to visit together)
4. Match to travelers' interest weights

Call out any free admission days and explicitly flag any venue with strict no-stroller, no-kids, or quiet-only policies.
```

### Step 4: Render output

Write `.myfootmarks/trips/<slug>/research/arts.md` with frontmatter that includes both metadata and the `places:` array from the subagent:

```yaml
---
topic: arts
generated_at: <ISO 8601>
consumed_inputs: [trip.yaml]
places:
  - id: <slug>
    name: <string>
    wikidata_id: <Qnnnnn | null>
    commons_filename: <string | null>
    image_url: <string | null>
    source: <string | null>
    archetype: <string | null>
    match_confidence: high | medium | low | null
    match_reason: <string | null>
    lat: <float | null>
    lon: <float | null>
    category: <string>
    lens: [arts]
    neighborhood: <string | null>
    address_street: <string | null>
  # …one entry per arts venue in the markdown body, same order
---
```

Below the frontmatter, write the Markdown body unchanged.

### Step 5: Log the run

```json
{"timestamp": "<ISO 8601>", "skill": "research-arts", "slug": "<slug>", "status": "ok", "consumed_inputs": ["trip.yaml"], "outputs_written": [".myfootmarks/trips/<slug>/research/arts.md"]}
```

On error: `"status": "error"` + `"reason"`, no output file.
