## Image resolution: delegate to `find-place-image`

For each entry in your `places:` array (or `dishes:` array, for `research-local-foods`), populate the image-resolution fields by invoking the `find-place-image` skill. **Do NOT** perform unverified `wbsearchentities` lookups inline — that path produced systemic misresolutions (Butchart Gardens → German Christmas store; BC Parliament → Bow Wow Wow band).

For each entity:

1. After resolving `name`, `category`, and (if available) `region` from `trip.yaml.destination`, invoke `find-place-image` with that triple. If you also have a confident `wikidata_id` from another source (e.g., a Wikipedia article that links to a Wikidata entity), pass it as well — `find-place-image` will run validate-mode and either confirm or reject it.

2. Take the resolver's JSON envelope and copy these fields directly into the corresponding `places:` (or `dishes:`) entry:
   - `wikidata_id` (may be null)
   - `commons_filename` (may be null)
   - `image_url` (may be null when status is `no-image`)
   - `source` (may be null when status is `no-image`)
   - `archetype` (always populated)
   - `match_confidence` → write to the entry's `match_confidence` field
   - `match_reason` → write to the entry's `match_reason` field

3. If the resolver returns `status: "no-image"`, that's a valid state — emit the entry with `wikidata_id: null`, `commons_filename: null`, `image_url: null`, `source: null`, but DO populate `archetype` and `match_reason`. The render handles `no-image` entries with a typography-only card (`data-variant="no-image"`).

4. **Do not retry or attempt manual lookups** when the resolver returns `no-image`. The trip planner can correct any single resolution after the first build via `trip.yaml.image_overrides`.

## Why this delegation matters

`find-place-image` is the one place where image-resolution logic lives. Improvements to it (e.g., better archetype heuristics, an additional source in a stack, a tightened P31 verifier) compound across every research skill automatically. The legacy per-skill inline Wikidata code is **deleted** during this migration; do not leave it commented out.
